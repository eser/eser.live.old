# Primitives: Philosophy and Guiding Principles

## Vision

Most of us share similar definitions for common UI patterns like accordion,
checkbox, combobox, dialog, dropdown, select, slider, and tooltip. These UI
patterns are
[documented by WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) and
generally understood by the community.

However, the implementations provided to us by the web platform are inadequate.
They're either non-existent, lacking in functionality, or cannot be customised
sufficiently.

As a result, developers are forced to build custom componentsâ€”an incredibly
difficult task. As a result, most components on the web are inaccessible,
non-performant, and lacking important features.

Our goal is to create a well-funded open-source component library that the
community can use to build accessible design systems.

## Principles

### Accessible

- Components adhere to WAI-ARIA guidelines and are tested regularly in a wide
  selection of modern browsers and assistive technologies.
- Where WAI-ARIA guidelines do not cover a particular use case, prior research
  is done to determine the patterns and behaviors we adopt when designing a new
  component. We look to similar, well-tested native solutions to capture nuances
  that WAI-ARIA guidelines may overlook.
- Developers should know about accessibility but shouldn't have to spend too
  much time implementing accessible patterns.
- Most behavior and markup related to accessibility should be abstracted, and
  bits that can't should be simplified where possible.
- Individual components will be tested to ensure maximum accessibility, but
  where app context is required the component library should provide useful
  guidance and supporting materials where possible to build fully accessible
  applications.
- Try to name things as closely to `aria` and `html` as possible where
  applicable; wherever we require developers to engage with accessibility
  directly, our platform should be a learning opportunity and a bridge for
  better understanding the underlying problems we solve.
- Components are thoroughly tested on a variety of devices and assistive
  technology, including all major screen reader vendors (VoiceOver, JAWS, NVDA);
  components respond and adapt effectively to input and appearance distinctions
  between platforms.

### Functional

- Components are feature-rich, with support for keyboard interaction, collision
  detection, focus trapping, dynamic resizing, scroll locking, native fallbacks,
  and more.

### Composable

- Components are designed with an open API that provides consumers with direct
  access to the underlying DOM node that is rendered to the page.
- We achieve this API with a 1-to-1 strategy, where a single component only
  renders a single DOM element (if a DOM node is rendered at all).
- Some abstractions may require slight deviation from this pattern, in which
  case the rationale should be clearly explained in supporting documentation.
- This API also empowers us to forward user-provided DOM refs to the correct
  underlying DOM node without doing anything too clever, meaning refs function
  exactly as the consumer would expect.
- Just as DOM nodes are composable, so are DOM event handlers; consumers should
  be able to pass their own event handlers directly to a component and stop
  internal handlers from firing.

### Customizable

- Components are built to be themed; no need to override opinionated styles, as
  primitives ship with zero presentational styles applied by default.
- Components ship with CSS-in-JS style objects that provide a minimal set styles
  needed to easily reset user agent styles and provide a clean slate for
  consumers to build upon.
- Our components can be composed or styled the same way underlying JSX
  components are composed or styled, with limitations only introduced to prevent
  UX/accessibility dark patterns where needed.
- Consumers can choose whether or not to apply these styles in their app, as
  well as the styling tool; we do not enforce a particular methodology or
  library.

## Other considerations

### Internationalization

- Components support international string formatting and make behavioral
  adjustments for right-to-left languages

### Stateful components can be controlled or uncontrolled

- Similar to form field JSX elements in React, all components with internal
  state can either be uncontrolled (internally managed) or controlled (managed
  by the consumer)

### Components exist in a finite number of predefined states

- State in this context refers to a component's state representable by a finite
  state machine; not to be confused with arbitrary stateful data as typically
  referenced in React libraries
- States are predetermined during the component design phase and expressed as
  strings in component code, making state transitions more explicit,
  deterministic, and clearer to follow
- Use the `data-state` attribute to expose a component's state directly to its
  DOM element
- When tempted to use a boolean to track a piece of stateful data, consider
  enumerated strings instead

### Developer experience

- Component APIs should be relatively intuitive and as declarative as possible
- Provide in-code documentation for complex/unclear abstractions for easier
  source debugging
- Anticipate errors and provide thorough console warnings with links back to
  documentation

### Balancing tradeoffs between design goals

- Composition is preferred over configuration
- Code clarity is preferred over bundle terseness except in extreme cases
- Smart abstractions preferred over over-exposing internal state

### Documentation

TODO

### Misc

- Not concerned with design system components like `Box`, `Chip` or `Badge` that
  provide visual language consistency but provide no underlying semantic meaning
  or abstracted behavior
- Keep file structure flat so logic is easier to follow; avoid early
  abstractions
- Don't repeat yourself _too much_ but don't be afraid to repeat yourself if an
  implementation detail hasn't been thoroughly vetted
